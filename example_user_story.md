Johnny and Jane's User Story
============

Johnny Appleseed is a boy with Type 1 diabetes. He has a data storage account with Tidepool, and he and his mom use Blip Notes to record context about his diabetes.

Jane Appleseed, Johnnyâ€™s mom, can log into Blip Notes and add notes on behalf of her son, Johnny. However, she does not have diabetes, so she has not created her own diabetes data storage account. As such, she cannot leave note for herself, only for Johnny. Johnny can also post notes for himself.

What are notes?
------------
Notes are simple: a message to add context to data. The primary purpose of Blip Notes is to add notes that become stored on the Tidepool platform. This way, you can add context quickly and on the go. A user can create, edit, and delete their notes.

Notes track the user who created them, the user they are for, the message text, as well as the timestamp.

Using Johnny's Account
------------
Log in using Johnny's login credentials. For frequent use, we recommend checking "remember me."

Take a look at some of the existing notes that we've created as Johnny. In the main feed, you can see notes that Johnny himself has posted, and that Jane has posted for Johnny.

Try adding notes by pressing the large, teal button at the bottom. You can change the timestamp for the note and type a message for the note. You can also easily add hashtags to the note by pressing any of the hashtag buttons in the view. Johnny will post context in his daily life: from issues like his insulin pump site falling out to his stress levels.

In the notes feed, some of the notes will have an edit button. This is useful for changing a note's content and timestamp. While logged in as Johnny, you can only edit the notes that Johnny created. Remember to save the changes you make!

From the same editing view, you can also choose to delete notes that you no longer need. You can only delete a note if you created it.

Using Jane's Account
------------
Log in using Jane's credentials. For frequent use, we recommend checking "remember me."

Like Johnny, Jane can see all of Johnny's notes in the feed. Jane can add notes for Johnny, and edit the notes she created. She can delete the notes she created.

Jane frequently checks Johnny's blood sugar in the middle of the night to be sure Johnny is not experiencing hyperglycemia, extremely high blood sugar levels, or hypoglycemia, extremely low blood sugar levels. As long as Jane is logged in, as soon as Blip Notes opens, a new note pops up. This is so it is quick and easy to add notes in the middle of the night, and even at other times of day.
