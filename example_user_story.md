Johnny and Jane's User Story
============

Johnny Appleseed is a boy with Type 1 diabetes. He has a data storage account with Tidepool, and he and his mom use Blip Notes to record context about his diabetes.

Jane Appleseed, Johnnyâ€™s mom, can log into Blip Notes and add notes on behalf of her son, Johnny. However, she does not have diabetes, so she has not created her own diabetes data storage account. As such, she cannot leave note for herself.
